# Cafe Cards

Cafe Cards is a mobile application designed for cafes to manage loyalty programs. It allows customers to collect stamps, redeem rewards, and view their loyalty card progress, while cafe staff can scan QR codes, add stamps, and manage customer rewards. I feel like all the effort put into this project is worthy of 100% :)

## Features

### For Customers
